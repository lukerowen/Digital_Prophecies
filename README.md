# Digital_Prophecies
 
Digital Prophecies utilizes GPT 3.5 (known for its use in ChatGPT) and virtual reality to allow users to speak with the Oracle of Delphi.

The tale of the Oracle of Delphi tells of a high priestess who communicated with the Greek Gods and deliver prophecies to those seeking her advice. The last known recordings of the Oracle were around 400 AD. Her legend is all that remains, but that is all that is needed to bring her back to life.

In March 2022, OpenAI (an American artificial intelligence research laboratory) released GPT 3.5: a large language based artificial intelligence which gained notoriety for its usage as the basis for ChatGPT. Using the language models developed by OpenAI, GPT 3.5 can act as a simulation of the Oracle, allowing for her to create new prophecies in the modern age.

By Integrating GPT 3.5 into the Unity video game engine, Digital Prophecies allows users to transport themselves back into ancient Greece through the use of Virtual Reality. Once again, anyone can seek advice from the all knowing Oracle.
